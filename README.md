## Abstract

Rice, a vital global grain, varies in appearance, taste, and nutrition across its varieties. Traditional manual methods for classifying rice are labor-intensive, costly, and inconsistent. This project addresses these challenges by implementing machine learning techniques to classify rice varieties based on grain images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved the highest accuracy of 96.12%, outperforming traditional machine learning models.
