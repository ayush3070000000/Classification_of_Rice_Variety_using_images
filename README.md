# Classification_of_Rice_Variety_using_images
This project focuses on automating the classification of different rice varieties using image-based machine learning techniques. By leveraging machine vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it aims to provide an efficient, non-destructive solution for classifying rice varieties based on grain attributes like shape, texture, and color.
